# C++-Projects
A classic console-based text adventure or simple roguelike game built purely in C++,
demonstrating strong OOP principles for character management, map generation, and state handling.
**Key Features / Powerful Takeaways:**
Object-Oriented Design (OOP): Implement classes for Player, Enemies, Items,
and Map tiles, showcasing inheritance and encapsulation.
Procedural Generation: Use simple algorithms (e.g., random number generation) to create unique
dungeon layouts and item placements for high replayability.
Game Loop: Master the fundamental game loop structure (Input -> Update -> Render) within the console environment.
State Management: Handle different game states like Menu, Playing, and GameOver.
